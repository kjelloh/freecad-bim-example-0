## Consider my experience and 'good to know' from doing the tutorial in Freecad 1.0 om my Macbook Pro M3 14" 18 GB?

	==> Zooom in and out is 'two fingers up or down on the trackpad" (Touchpad navigation setting)

![](/images/image-1.png)

Zooom in and out: 'two fingers up or down on the trackpad"
Translate view: <Shift> + one finger on track pad
Rotate view: <Option> + one finger on trackpad
 

	==> 'Create Building' starts a new tree structure with 'Building' as the root

![](/images/image-2.png)    --> ![](/images/image-3.png)
Note: I renamed the Budiling to 'House' by editing its 'Label'


	==> 'Create Level' is used to create a 'floor' and I need to drag-and-drop it under the 'Building' root

![](/images/image-4.png)  --> ![](/images/image-5.png)
Note: I renamed the Level by editing its 'Label'.

	==> 'Split Edge' is required to actually split (a line point does not automatically split an edge / line)

![](/images/image-6.png)
Note: 'Slit Edge' is a submenu of 'Trim Edge' in <Sketcher Tools>.


	==> Consider to Select items before clicking on a 'Constraint'?

I tried to click 'Constraint Coincident' and then two 'points' but had a hard time making the constraint take effect.

Maybe it works better if I first select the two points and then click the constraint (like the presenter does in the video)?
